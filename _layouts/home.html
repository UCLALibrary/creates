            <p class="mb-0">The C.R.E.A.T.E.S. (Concept Map, Read, Elucidate the hypotheses, Analyze and interpret the data, Think of the next Experiment, and Synthesize) method is a new teaching approach that uses intensive analysis of primary literature to demystify and humanize research science for undergraduates.
            
            <p>Our goal is to use the real language of science—the journal article—as an inroad to understanding “who does science, how, and why?”</p>
            
            <p>At the same time, we wish to help students:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>experience authentic processes of science, in particular discussion and debate about experimental data and their interpretation (including ‘grey areas’),</li>
                <li>recognize the creativity and open-ended nature of research, and</li>
                <li>see the diversity of people who undertake research careers (i.e. not just the genius/geeks of popular culture).</li>
            </ol>
              
            <p>As a complement to teaching based on textbooks, which tend to oversimplify the research process, C.R.E.A.T.E.S. teaching focuses on authentic published work–peer reviewed journal articles—with students reading either series of papers produced sequentially from individual labs or series of papers from different labs focused on a single line of research.</p>
            
            <h3>C.R.E.A.T.E.S. Overarching Learning Objectives</h3>
              <ol>
                  <li>Identify the components of the scientific method (prior research, hypothesis, methods, experimental controls and variables, results, conclusions, etc.) in journal articles.</li>
                  <li>Infer the rationale for the experimental approach used in a journal article.</li>
                  <li>Interpret and explain the basic construction of the experimental protocol, and explain its alignment to the hypothesis.</li>
                  <li>Analyze figures from scientific articles and draw conclusions from these figures.</li>
                  <li>Synthesize the information from the various components of a journal article to construct a narrative flow for the research presented in the article.</li>
