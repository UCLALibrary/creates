                  <p>You can learn so much about an article from the introduction! Here's a step-by-step process for getting the most out of the article intro:</p>
                  <h3>How to read the introduction: <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="How and where does this work happen? For example in annotations on the article? In a notebook? A page they attach to the article? Maybe a handout we make for them?">?</button></h3>
                  <p>Defining key terms you find in the introduction will help you identify uncertainties and set you up for a better understanding the article. Identifying the research question is essential for grasping the article as a whole. Identifying experimental variables and their relationships is key to going beyong definitions and figuring out how concepts interact.</p>
                          <ol>
                              <li>Define the key terms and read up on any unfamiliar concepts.  <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Where do learners go for definitions? Do they copy/paste or state them in their own words?">?</button> </li>
                              <li>Identify what was already known about the topic and what research questions or problems have yet to be addressed.<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Does this mean identify the parts of the intro that discuss previous research? What do we do after we identify? Do we summarize somewhere or just keep in mind?">?</button></li>
                              <li>What are the key experimental variables? <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="where does this information go? in a notebook? would a handout be helpful? Should students state in their own words?">?</button></li>
                              <li>What are the goals and/or hypotheses of the paper? In other words, how is this paper proposing to fill in the gaps in our understanding?<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="where does this information go?">?</button></li>
                              <li>See if you can identify general methodologies or experimental approaches that were used to answer the questions or test the hypotheses.<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="where does this information go?">?</button></li>
                              <li>Make note of any hypotheses, because you will need to come back to these later.<button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary btn-small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="where does this information go?">?</button></li>
                          </ol>

                  <h3>Tips</h3>
                          <ul>
                              <li>Have lots of scratch paper handy.</li>
                              <li>Read the article once all the way through before starting your map.</li>
                              <li>Prefer to work on a computer? <a href="https://cmap.ihmc.us/">Try Cmap, a free concept mapping software.</a></li>
                              <li>The main purpose of the introduction is often to show the relationships between current knowledge and the research question. Make sure your concept map shows this!</li>
                          </ul>
                  <h3>Your turn!</h3>
                  <p>Make your own concept map! Use this checklist to make sure your concept map includes everything it needs.</p>
                        <ul>
                              <li>Concepts in order from broad to narrow.</li>
